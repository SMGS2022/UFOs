UFO Sightings, utilizing JavaScript

## Overview

A client requested a user-friendly table illustrating UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. By incorporating filters of multiple criteria; gatherance of information is a click away. While JavaScript was used to create the table, HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, granted the ability to design an asthetic website.

## Results

### Before Filters Applied
When initially observing the website, the user views several generated outcomes.

### After Filters Applied
Once the user toggles the filters, a more concise list generates with the specific information requested. The photo illustrates one populated outcome for benton, ar in 2010.

## Summary
### Drawback:
When interacting with the filters, the user has to be quite particular. The user must know the exact date, shape, city, spelling, etc.; while also remaining in lowercase form, as the filter interface is case-sensitive. 

### Recommendations:
1. Include a non-case-sensitive function
2. Include a date range, instead of needing to be precise
